<h1>Algorithm Explorer</h1>
Algorithm Explorer is an interactive web application designed to visually showcase and compare the efficiency and use-cases of various algorithms, including greedy algorithms, merge sort, and other divide and conquer strategies. This educational tool aims to demystify complex algorithmic concepts, making them accessible and engaging to students, educators, and programming enthusiasts alike.


<h2>Optimal Study Plan Suggestion</h2>
The Optimal Study Plan Suggestion is designed to assist students in optimizing their study schedules, ensuring they allocate their time most effectively across various subjects. It is an educational tool that takes into account students' current performance in subjects, the amount of time they have already invested in studying, and their available time for further study. By analyzing these factors, the application proposes a personalized study plan that prioritizes subjects where the student can achieve the most significant improvement, ensuring an efficient and targeted approach to learning.

<h3>How It Works</h3>
The application operates on a straightforward yet powerful principle: it asks students to input their midterm marks for each subject, the hours they have already dedicated to studying each subject, and their total available hours for future study. Using this information, it employs a heuristic approach, inspired by <b>greedy algorithms</b>, to allocate study hours. This method prioritizes subjects based on the potential for improvement, suggesting that students invest more time in areas where they are currently underperforming.
